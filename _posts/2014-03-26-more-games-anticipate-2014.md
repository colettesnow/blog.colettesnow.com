## 10 More Games I Anticipate During 2014

**Apologies!** This has been sitting in my drafts completed since early February. I am only just posting now. :( I should have some reviews coming soon just as soon I as complete Pokémon Y and Final Fantasy Lightning Returns.

It seems the first time I wrote this post I neglected to mention a few games. These are the other games I am looking forward to in the coming year.

### Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze _Releases February 22_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSxDAyit9ak)
Even though I did not get to play them until the 2000’s, I really enjoyed the Donkey Kong Country series. I haven’t yet had a chance to play the previous entry on the Wii but given the gameplay that has been shown this far, I am still looking forward to this. It seems to capture the gameplay of the originals, spice it up a bit and bring the game into a new generation. I need a Wii U first but it looks like I should enjoy this game when that time comes. I love platformers.

### Tales of Symphonia: Chronicles _Releases February 28_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74ZpRGd8cK0)
As I said in the previous entry, I absolutely adore the Tale series. It’s the series that entrenched my interest in RPGs and despite the cliche’s, I love it. The first Symphonia game happens to be my favourite game in the Tales series, though it was my second entry having played the DeJap translation of Tales of Phantasia first and the Wii-sequel wasn’t bad either despite an unfortunate departure from the cell-shaded art style and the loss of some of the English voice actors. I look forward to returning to Sylvarant and Tethalla and making the journey of regeneration once more.

### Final Fantasy X+X2 HD _Releases March 20_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=end0IjrmZik)
Final Fantasy X was one of my first games on the PlayStation 2 after Tales of the Abyss which was my first (yes, I was late to the PS2, very late). At this point, I had played Final Fantasy 4, 6, 7, and 9 – all games I enjoyed immensely and thus had high hopes for Final Fantasy X. I was not disappointed. I loved the return to non-active turn based game-play though I felt the world was a little linear. The game was beautiful even for 2008 when I finally got to play it – I only had a CRT at the time. While I own the sequel X-2, I haven’t played through it beyond the introduction. I am looking forward to revisiting these two titles in HD.

### BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma _Releases March 25_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeEJ_Hls5tY)
BlazBlue Continuum Shift was the first serious (non-arena/smash) fighting game I got into after Dragon Ball Z Hyper Dimension for the Super Nintendo. It combined lovely anime sprites with a fighting system that while filled with depth was also relatively easy to get into compared to Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat. I am looking forward to continuing the story of BlazBlue and more of the stunningly fluid fighting of its predecessors. I have since enjoyed those two previously mentioned games but I doubt I would have tried them had I not got to play BlazBlue.

### Dark Souls II _Releases April 25_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJqRpvebCY)
I still have to properly beat the first Dark Souls which I intend to do before picking this installment up. I really enjoyed Demon’s Souls and Dark Souls, the difficulty is refreshing and never in a cheap way. It’s always my fault when I die. This is not to mention the expansive world with many opportunities to explore and being rewarded for doing so or killed in the process. I am getting the PC release, so I have to wait until the end of April.

### Watch_Dogs _Releases May 27_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGZ1fwKcEmc)
When I saw this game, I thought it felt like a modern-day Assassin’s Creed game-play wise and I don’t seem to be alone in that observation. From the sounds of things, much like the reference to Assassin’s Creed in Far Cry 3, we could have a bit of a shared universe thing going on which I usually enjoy if I executed well. I am kind of glad they delayed this game, not only will we get a better game than we would otherwise have but given so many games are coming out in Q1, it’s nice to be able to break things up.

### Mario Kart 8 _Releases May 31_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU7tXqYplA8)
Who doesn’t love Mario Kart? Super Mario Kart and 64 were quite awesome kart racing games. I didn’t enjoy the GameCube installment quite as much but it was still fun. The portable games are fun, solid kart racers too but Mario Kart has always felt best on a console to me. I have kind of let Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed fill the void during the previous generation of consoles but I am ready to pick this installment up when the time comes.

### Dragon Age: Inquisition _Releases Q3_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzuR1Fn_b48)
I took a risk on the PS3 release of Origins back in 2010. Until that point, Bioware was only known to me in passing in that they make Star Wars rpgs, something I wasn’t particularly interested in and I was until that time almost solely playing JRPGs in the genre (Oblivion aside). I watched a few YouTube videos, reviews and was intrigued by the effect the Origins may have on the story. I played that through about half way over several months before picking up the PC release and completing the game on that (much better on PC). I did enjoy II despite the recycled level design and have been waiting for the sequel ever since. That sequel is finally coming in Inquisition and it looks beautiful judging from the trailers.

### Kingdom Hearts 2.5 ReMix _Release TBA_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgOTOpTAxMs)
So with the 2013 release of Kingdom Hearts 1.5, I was finally able to experience the first and second Kingdom Hearts games from start to finish. I had the chance to play the first Kingdom Hearts on the PS2 but I already had the PS3 at that point and with so many great releases coming out, it completely slipped through my fingers. I may be several years late but I look forward to continuing my adventures with Sora and his companions.

### Super Smash Brothers for Wii U and 3DS _Release TBA_ [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvudMu-5kIU)
I played the original N64 release at friends houses in the 90’s and have been in relatively little contact with the sequels. The smash-like game Digimon Rumble Arena captured my own interest at home, especially the PSone version. By the time I got a GameCube, I was mostly playing role-playing games and the sequels slipped right past me. Nonetheless, especially with the addition of Mega Man to the mix, I am looking forward to the latest iteration of this series. Depending on whether I have a Wii U by the time this comes out, will determine whether I get this for the 3DS or Wii U though I’ll probably repurchase the game when the time (Wii U) comes.
